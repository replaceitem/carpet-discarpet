# Discarpet Values

Discarpet adds various new value types to scarpet, that wrap a Discord value.
This page lists all of them and which values can be queried from it.
Querying happens just like with scarpets entity values: `channel~'value'`.
All Discarpet values have a type name (which you get from `type()`) with the prefix `dc_`.

`topic` (String) The topic of the channel (See `dc_set_channel_topic`)

`id` (String) ID of the channel

`mention_tag` (String) Mention tag for the channel. This can be put inside a message for the channel to be a clickable link.
