`file`

Used for resolving a file from various sources for use in discord attachments, embed images and more.

Files can come from scarpet's resource system, urls, raw bytes or from an image value from [Scarpet Graphics](https://modrinth.com/mod/scarpet-graphics).
You can only provide one of `file`, `url`, `string`, `base64` and `image`.

Files can also be parsed directly from an image or string value. String values will be used as `url` if it matches the url schema. Otherwise, it is used as `file`.

This works the same way as the first parameter of [`read_file`](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/docs/scarpet/Full.md#read_fileresource-type), except that the file extension must always be given.                 |

If true, this resolves the file like [`read_file`](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/docs/scarpet/Full.md#read_fileresource-type) does with a type prefixed with `shared_`. Defaults to false. |
