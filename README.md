## A Carpet extension for discord bot functionality

![Discarpet](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/replaceitem/carpet-discarpet/master/src/main/resources/assets/discarpet/icon.png)

This is an extension for [fabric-carpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet)
that adds parts of the Discord bot API as
[scarpet](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/wiki/Scarpet) functions.

This allows you to code Discord bots that run within Minecraft, and interact with the Minecraft world.

**Requires [Carpet mod](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/releases)**
